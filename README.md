#  Don't Disturb the Cat

Don't Disturb the Cat was a project built in response to the Gatsby Silly Site Challenge. The main idea and assets for the site came from my middle school child and the site was a 1-day build utilizing the default Gatsby Starter.

## Motivation

I've been using Gatsby for a few month now to complete a redesign of [LiquidChurch.com](https://liquidchurch.com) and have been amazed at site performance. Wanting to engage my middle school child in design, I've given her the challenge to come up with a Silly Site idea and this is the result.

## Development Considerations

* The site is built from Gatsby's default starter.
* Utilize gatsby-image plugin to develop a static image server that optimizes image loading based on screen size.
* Develop functions to hide and show images based on setTimeout timer.
* Include two different set of cat state, one for the cat in idle state and one for the cat in disturbed state.
* Ensure proper alt text is available for screen readers for the various cat states image.

## Deploy

As the site is completely static and does not use any external content management system, the site is completely hosted on and served using Gatsby Cloud.
